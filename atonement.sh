#   • paper   — autogenerate the artifact as a real PR through the gate
#   • guided  — console-only (no API): deep-link + exact click steps, and with
#               --guided, open the real page in Playwright with a step overlay
# Nothing destructive runs without an explicit typed confirmation. Run from inside
# a shadow-installed repo (genesis installs this file at the repo root).
#
#   ./atonement.sh              walk every item, interactively
#   ./atonement.sh --guided     open console-only items in a guided browser
#   ./atonement.sh --only org-2fa   fix one item
